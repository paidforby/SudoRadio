# SudoRadio 

audio cache-n-stream stations for distributed, off-grid networks.  

this is a work in progress, any audio/visual content include in this repo is solely for testing purposes (i.e. please don't sue me Roger Waters).   

## To setup up a SudoRadio Station
For development, it is recommended to install pre-requistes inside a python virtual environment. To configure virtualenv, see https://codeselfstudy.com/wiki/Virtualenv.  
Once inside the virtualenv,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Go to http://localhost:5000 to listen to the demo audio and request a new song.
